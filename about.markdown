The cultivation of stingless bee honey in Sarawak is part of a growing honey industry in the region. Stingless bee honey is produced by stingless bees, which are smaller compared to regular honey bee. These stingless bees produce honey in nests they build in various places such as underground, in tree crevices, or in man-made structures.

Stingless bee honey farmers in Sarawak often use both traditional methods and modern technology to promote optimal honey production. Most farmers focus on the care of stingless bees, the provision of suitable hives, and effective honey harvesting techniques that do not damage the hives.

Thus, the main goals of the project are to help increase additional income, improve living standards, and create job opportunities for the targeted communities. In line with the aim of restructuring the economy towards a more progressive, knowledge-based, and high-value economy, or a high-income economy with community participation, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), through its research outcomes and existing expertise, has conducted knowledge and technology transfer activities in the implementation of the project in Sarawak.
