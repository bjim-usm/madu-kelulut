Honey as per mentioned in the Holy Quran is uniquely produced by honeybees (Apis sp.) and stingless bees (Meliponini sp.)

*“And your Lord inspired the bee, “Take for yourself among the mountains, houses, and among the trees and [in] that which they construct. Then eat from all the fruits and follow the ways of your Lord laid down [for you].” There emerges from their bellies a drink [honey], varying in colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed, that is a sign for people who think.”*  
[An-Nahl: 68-69]

### Antioxidant Properties
Stingless bee honey contains high levels of antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress and neutralize free radicals. This can support overall cellular health and potentially reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

### Anti-Inflammatory Effects
Research suggests that stingless bee honey may possess anti-inflammatory properties, which can be beneficial in managing conditions related to inflammation, such as arthritis or inflammatory skin conditions.

### Antimicrobial Activity
Studies have shown that stingless bee honey has natural antimicrobial properties. It can inhibit the growth of various bacteria and fungi, making it useful for wound care and as a natural remedy for infections.

### Digestive Health
The prebiotic properties of stingless bee honey can support gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. This can aid digestion and contribute to overall gastrointestinal well-being.

### Wound Healing
Due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, stingless bee honey is often used in traditional medicine for wound healing. It helps keep wounds clean and promotes faster healing.

### Immune Support
The nutritional content of stingless bee honey, including vitamins and minerals, can bolster the immune system, helping the body to better fend off illnesses.


Tropical Meliponini bees produce stingless bee honey (SBH). Studies have shown beneficial properties, including antibacterial, bacteriostatic, anti-inflammatory, neurotherapeutic, neuroprotective, wound, and sunburn healing capabilities. High phenolic acid and flavonoid concentrations offer SBH its benefits.
